In this repository we are going to introduce you an ANN based SOx and NOx emissions prediction from a thermal power plant in Iran. 
The aim of this work is to predict the amount of emissions when the sensors of power plant do not work. 

ANN has been developed in MATLAB toolbox and the second step is to optimize the operational parameters of power plant to have the minimum amount of emissions by GA.
